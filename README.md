# Renewable-Energy-Consumption

🚀 Harnessing the Power of Data for Renewable Energy Insights! 🌍⚡



🔹 First, I leveraged Amazon AWS by creating an S3 bucket to store raw data, configured IAM roles, and connected it seamlessly to Snowflake for scalable data warehousing.

🔹 Using SQL & Snowflake transformations, I performed data cleaning and analysis, ensuring optimized performance before importing the dataset into Tableau.

🔹 The interactive Tableau dashboard provides insights into:
✅ Types of natural/renewable energy sources
✅ Monthly energy usage (KWH) and trends
✅ Cost savings in USD from sustainable energy adoption
✅ Dynamic filtering by region, energy source, and country to explore insights at a granular level.

This project highlights the power of cloud integration, data transformation, and visualization to drive actionable insights in the renewable energy sector.
